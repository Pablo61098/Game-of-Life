# Game-of-Life
<h1>Python implementation of Conway's Game of Life</h1>


This code impements Conway's Game of Life. I like this one a lot so here it is for the record.

run <b>$ python3 game_of_life.py</b> to get default execution. It will be a random setup with a grid of 100x100.

To get cool result run <b>$ python3 game_of_life.py --gliders</b>.
