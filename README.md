# Game-of-Life
<h1>Python implementation of Conway's Game of Life</h1>


This code impements Conway's Game of Life. I like this one a lot so here it is for the record.

run <b>$ python3 game_of_life.py</b> to get default execution. It will be a random setup with a grid of 100x100.

To get cool result run <b>$ python3 game_of_life.py --gliders</b>.

Size of grid can be changed by setting <b>--grid-size N</b>. With N as the grid size (NxN).

Run with <b>--make-video videoName.mp4</b> to get a video output of your execution. Frames are set to 300.
